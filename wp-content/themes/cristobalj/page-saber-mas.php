Individuals, at the same time, can have a positive and a negative vision from their great-grandparents, grandparents and parents, thus converting each relative into a double entity: one luminous and the other obscure. Two energy fields that, despite opposing, are complementary. In the present time, the spirit that materializes adjoins the matter that is spiritualized, the supraconscious with the unconscious, the attempt to realize the future with the intent to repeat the past, the essential being with the socio-cultural being, the desire to create with the desire to imitate. To the study of the genealogical tree under its simultaneous and complementary aspects, treasure and trap, I have called it Metagenealogy.</p>
          <p>Alejandro Jodorowsky (creator of Metagenalogy)</p>

          <p>Metagenealogy is a method of analysis of the genealogical tree that allows to expand the vision of its psychic dimension. This makes us understand to what extent what we think, feel, desire or live, as well as our conflicts and illnesses can be the result of a family, social, historical or patriarchal educational waste. The metagenealogy reveals a system of repetitions of dates, illnesses, births, deaths, accidents and names. All these are maps that are traversed and transmitted from generation to generation until they reach us with the precision of a clock. We tend to identify ourselves and be faithful to our relatives, to the point that it can be painful, paralyzing and self destructive. At the same time, these characters - to whom we maintain loyalty - imitated other figures of the past, forming a hereditary chain of prisons. Revealing the dynamics of the clan allows us to understand what inhibits within us the possibility of living, creating, being and loving from the essential being. On the other hand, it is essential to accept that everything is perfect and that the genealogy is a perfect spiritual process in action, that is never wrong, that has its laws and orders and that everything always has its raison d'etre, although we do not always like it or we agree One does not work to repair something that 'should not' have been, but rather to accept it as it was and integrate it from the soul. Very often, after a genealogical analysis, Cristobal prepares a family psychic or psychomagnetic constellation, where he invites a group to dramatize the situations seen and re-align them with the current of life.
          <br>Tarot For Carl Gustav Jung, the archetypes are innate energies common to all human beings, which are transmitted through myths or appear in dreams, stories, legends, rituals and works of art. They would be the organs of our psychological organism that, collaborating, allow our transformative alchemical process to take place. In the Tarot, the archetypes can act as patterns of behavior when the individual needs to solve an existential difficulty. The 78 arcana of the Tarot are archetypes with infinite interpretations, where each one has a multitude of aspects. However, the drawing of the letter will be only a mask. It becomes the key that, if you know how to interpret and integrate it, will activate the allied dimension of the archetype. For this, CristÃ³bal Jodorowsky uses the arcana of the Tarot as doors to contact with universal energies in himself. These doors, when activated, allow a profound change in the psyche, so that our soul expresses itself in all freedom.

          <br>In ancient cultures there were 'cuts' of gods that in the background could be dimensions of our own mind. CristÃ³bal's work with the Tarot is to awaken the courts of gods or inner archetypes of each being, using the arcana as a therapeutic tool that allows us to get in touch with our inner world and observe our acquired patterns of behavior, in order to create an internal structure of reference. The Tarot allows us to interpret the human psyche and the different dimensions of our consciousness. Thanks to its symbolic nature, we can see reflected our deeper reality in the arcane, a situation that will help us focus reality from another angle, and integrate life difficulties, sorrows and pain more easily. The Tarot can also be a spectacular representation of our inner family, a mirror of our intimate world that reflects our knots and genealogical burdens, conflicts or complex relationships with parents, grandparents, brothers and other relatives of the present or the past. It also reflects our neurotic repetitions, the cycles in which we are trapped, the mechanisms by which we become ill ... All this, in one direction: the encounter with the deepest of our Essential Being.  Even though the Tarot is an instrument that communicates us with the unconscious dimension. Cristobal thinks that when one chooses a letter it is the supra-conscious dimension (that knows everything) that chooses it in us to help us unveil what the ego is not always willing to see for fear of changing the frame of reference and mutate.

          <?php printf(__("<p>Psychomagic is the therapeutic technique, initiated by Alejandro Jodorowsky, who combines shamanism, folk magic, psychology, intuition, mysticism, oriental philosophy, art, with a healing purpose. Psychomagia is a healing practice that acts through the symbol, metaphor and beauty, essentially with the language of dreams. By not considering the unconscious dimension as an enemy and losing the fear of seeing oneself, one can discover the traumas that cause suffering. However, even if one knows what happens to him and why, he is not entirely free of pain. Psychomagia does not pretend - like psychoanalysis - to heal through the word by converting the messages that the unconscious dimension sends into a rational discourse, but to teach the rational to handle unconscious language.
          <br>The processes of our brain are more symbolic and analogical than logical. For him, a photograph not only represents the person portrayed, but is herself. Consider a part as the whole, project people who populate their memory about real beings or things. In the psychomagy the client is proposed concrete actions, to perform a symbolic act that, in some way, will restore his memory and allow him to perform the unrealizable.

          <br>However, to ensure that the act gives an optimal result, the consultant must first free himself from the morality imposed by his family, society and culture. If you do so, for example, without fear, you can paste a photograph of your father on two watermelons and you can blow them up. Its unconscious dimension will take for granted murder and castration. The consultant will feel more free. That which frightens us loses strength the moment we stop fighting it or moving it away from the mind to integrate it through a psychomagic act that helps us to awaken and make life a lucid dream full of consciousness. It is not enough to understand the reason for a conflict; we must act on it, give it an outlet to the impulse, to the repetitive behavior that makes our existence difficult. This is how psychomagia was created, psychochamanism and, later, the psychroritual.

The participation in the rituals and trance sessions of the mediums in the initiatory trips is for CristÃ³bal Jodorowsky a possibility of research on shamanism. This means that the phenomenology is analyzed in the cults visited in order to reinterpret it in the light of the knowledge of psychotherapy and the paradigms of today. These initiatory groups focus on moving from the popular forms of spiritual and magical beliefs to psycho-shamanism, where toxic and religious folkloric aspects are left aside to preserve the essence of psychic functioning. Thus, consciously and autonomously they are applied autonomously to the management of psychic potentials. In these rites, the forms of participation in worship are respected with their language and liturgies, but this does not mean that the group feels identified with their cosmology and spiritual vision. Over the past few years, these groups have toured the shamanic work centers of the favelas of the big cities, El Salto del Angel in Venezuela, the sacred mountain of Sorte, (center of the cult of MarÃ­a Lionza), the jungles of Orinoco, the Peruvian Andean mountain range, and a long etcetera. These initiatic travelers visited the Market of the Witches of Mexico City, Yucatan, the Lacandon jungles and the Mayan sites; They participated in sacred ceremonies on Mount Tepozteco and experienced indigenous temazcales.</p>
          <p>In these works, travelers can work day after day with shamans and healers of different spiritual traditions, integrating a holistic view of the traditional cosmovisions of the American continent.
